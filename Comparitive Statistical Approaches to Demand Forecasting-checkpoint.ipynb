    "![alt text](https://imgur.com/LjtBXwf.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance of the series should not be a function of time. This property is known as homoscedasticity. Notice in the red graph the varying spread of data over time. \n",

    "\n",
    "Finally, the covariance of the i th term and the (i + m) th term should not be a function of time. In the following graph, you will notice the spread becomes closer as the time increases. Hence, the covariance is not constant with time for the ‘red series’. \n",
    "![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/6HVlvg2.png)  \n",
    "Why is this important? When running a linear regression the assumption is that all of the observations are all independent of each other. In a time series, however, we know that observations are time dependent. It turns out that a lot of nice results that hold for independent random variables (law of large numbers and central limit theorem to name a couple) hold for stationary random variables. So by making the data stationary, we can actually apply regression techniques to this time dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways you can check the stationarity of a time series. The first is by looking at the data. By visualizing the data it should be easy to identify a changing mean or variation in the data. For a more accurate assessment there is the Dickey-Fuller test. I won’t go into the specifics of this test, but if the ‘Test Statistic’ is greater than the ‘Critical Value’ than the time series is stationary. Below is code that will help you visualize the time series and test for stationarity.\n",

    "We know that the PACF only describes the direct relationship between an observation and its lag. This would suggest that there would be no correlation for lag values beyond k.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the expectation of the ACF and PACF plots for an AR(k) process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Moving Average Intuition\n",
    "Consider a time series that was generated by a moving average (MA) process with a lag of k.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that the moving average process is an autoregression model of the time series of residual errors from prior predictions. Another way to think about the moving average model is that it corrects future forecasts based on errors made on recent forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would expect the ACF for the MA(k) process to show a strong correlation with recent values up to the lag of k, then a sharp decline to low or no correlation. By definition, this is how the process was generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the PACF, we would expect the plot to show a strong relationship to the lag and a trailing off of correlation from the lag onwards.\n",
